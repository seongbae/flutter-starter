# Flutter Starter App
A modern, production-ready Flutter starter template with best practices, clean architecture, and essential features pre-configured. Perfect for quickly bootstrapping new Flutter projects with a solid foundation.

Note: This is a fork of the original flutter starter app at https://github.com/momentous-developments/flutter-starter-app.  I've modified the design little bit and plan to make it work seamlessly with a backend admin panel that I plan to release separately as an open source project.  The backend will be built with Laravel and Filament.

## 🚀 Features

- **State Management**: Riverpod 2.0 with code generation support
- **Routing**: GoRouter for declarative navigation
- **Dependency Injection**: Built-in with Riverpod

### UI/UX Features
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Theme System**: Material 3 with light/dark mode support
